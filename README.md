# Front-end exercise

See the [development guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Process

1. Fork this repository into your account and work there.
2. Make your repo private
3. Add the following collaborators to your repo:
   - `brettdewoody`
   - `jordanpapaleo`
   - `denis-sokolov`
   - `mentos`
4. Commit changes on the `main` branch or on new branches, whichever you prefer.
5. Deploy your project so it's publicly available on the web. One option is [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), but many other options exist.
6. Let us know if you have any questions, and when you're finished with the project, in the designated Slack channel.

You can change any existing code or dependencies. Ideally add a brief explanation why.

At the end of the exercise, please replace the contents of this README with your explanations of what you’ve done, added, changed, or anything else that makes sense to document.

## Tasks

The exercise has a list of improvements to be made to the project. There are purposefully too many tasks, there is no goal to do all of them. The items at the top of the list are more important than items at the bottom. Project designs are available [in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/0502uQRIymsq7BEQBhid91bV/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1).

Use your judgement working on the tasks. It’s okay to skip a task that is needlessly difficult. It’s great to add something that’s not on the list if it does not cost a lot of effort. It’s okay to change UI design and behavior if you have good input, as long as you communicate the changes.

- [ ] Add a “No Reviews Yet” screen to the Review Feedback section.
- [ ] Improve the layout on smaller screens. In particular, the Review feedback view looks bad right now.
- [ ] Add a feature to skip a question.
- [ ] Add a feature to save a questionairre and continue it later.
- [ ] Add more question types: a multiple choice, a rating slider.
- [ ] Handle network errors when submitting feedback
- [ ] Add a questionairre completion indicator.
- [ ] Handle avatar loading errors, make them look nicer.
- [ ] Add a view for feedback you have received.
- [ ] Fix the background style. Right now it depends on the page length, so when a user navigates between different pages, the bottom right corner of the background shifts around.
- [ ] Add a feedback period selector.
